- Project Overview

In the eXAI Image Insight Tool, we aim to simplify the understanding of image-based machine learning across diverse domains, particularly medical imagery for medical professionals and general object recognition. As a result of this tool, users can make informed decisions based on model predictions that are robust, transparent, and easy to interpret. Having this level of transparency is crucial for building trust in AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) technologies as well as facilitating deeper research into model behaviours.

The primary users of our tool are non-technical stakeholders, who are domain experts who require deeper insights into the operational mechanisms of a machine learning model. Understanding why the model makes specific predictions is difficult for these users to understand, especially when the predictions if wrong can be life-threatening to humans. Practical implementations require user trust and model validation, both of which are hindered by a lack of clear, interpretable insights. Our tool aims to provide concise, useful model interpretations to address these issues.

Competitive tools like Shapash which uses libraries like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)  and SHAP (SHapley Addictive exPlanations) offer model interpretation and explanation. However, they tend to focus on non-image data or fail to address the challenges introduced by image data in various domains. For instance, LIME offers localised interpretability, but it is not scalable. SHAP, although extensive, requires significant computational resources and specialised knowledge to adapt to the complexity of the image dataset. Our tool will handle this shortcoming as it would be tailored to handle the high dimensional data that comes with images. This focus will enable more precise and relevant model explanations, making advanced machine-learning models more accessible and understandable to users across varied fields.

- Team Management

Our team conducts regular meetings three times a week to ensure continuous progress and effective collaboration. Each meeting follows a structured format with an agenda review, progress updates, open discussion, task assignment, and a wrap-up to summarise key points and set goals for the next meeting. Initially, we focused on brainstorming and selecting a suitable topic for our project. We then moved on to writing a detailed proposal outlining our objectives and methodologies. After finalising the topic, our discussions shifted towards implementation strategies and project planning. We are currently refining our project plan and ensuring all team members are aligned with the upcoming tasks.
